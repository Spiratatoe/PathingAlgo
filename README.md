# PathingAlgo
For a programming competition, I was tasked with designing a pathing algorithm that solves mazes built with hexagonal grids


the hexagonal boxes are represented with the hexagonal effective coordinate system
postion is based on a a,r,c coordinate

read mazes that are sent to you via json files
